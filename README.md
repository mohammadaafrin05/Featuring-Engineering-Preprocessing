# Statistical Analysis on Vectors and Matrices

This repository contains Python scripts to perform statistical analysis, including computing:
1. Mean and variance of a vector.
2. Covariance between two vectors.
3. Correlation between two vectors.
4. Covariance and correlation matrix for a dataset (MxN matrix).

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy

### Instructions:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run each script to compute the respective statistics.
